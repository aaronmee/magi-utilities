# under construction

I'm trying to setup a git repo where you can easy find useful files and guides about XMG or magi. 
I'm also trying to find my time to work on it. 


# magi-help
Copyright (c) 2022 aaronmidnight

The goal of this repo is to provide useful files and guides for the usage of coin magi. 

# Installation
There are different types of files for the installation of the magi core wallet:

  * All-in-one bash files. Those files download everything needed and install the magi wallet. Recommended for new users. 
    
    They can be found under install_magid
    - As of now there are only files for the magi daemon.  
    - Those are split between the different architectures. Choose the one according to your device. 
  
  * Bash files that complete different subgoals. Recommended if you alredy worked with xmg but don't know certain steps.
